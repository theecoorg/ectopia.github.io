              <h1>Ectopia</h1>
              <p>This paper outlines plans for a new decentralized, independent, self-sustainable ecosystem, a societal design, an economic model and a digital network design that together aim to build new ecosystems to empower people through innovation.</p>

              <h2 id="introduction">Problem</h2>
              <h4>Climate Crisis</h4>
              <p>90% of the world’s largest cities are situated on the waterfront. By 2050, over 570 low-lying coastal cities will face projected sea level rise by at least 0.5 meters.<sup>1</sup> By 2030, a projected 27% of people worldwide will be concentrated in cities with at least 1 million inhabitants.<sup>2</sup></p>

              <h4>Socioeconomic Inequality</h4>
              <p>1 billion people lack proof of identity. There are over 1.7 billion people globally who are unbanked or underserved with respect to financial services.<sup>3</sup> Income inequality continues to be on the rise in many countries around the world, the richest 1% now hold a larger percentage of national income than ever before. </p>

              <h4>Big Tech Monopoly</h4>
              <p>58% of the world population relies on the internet. The ‘Big Five’ tech companies – typically identified as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet’s Google hold the majority of the world’s online data and primary channels of access that people rely on to engage with the internet. The business models of these companies rely heavily on user data.<sup>4</sup> </p>

              <h2>Opportunity</h2>
              <ul>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Countries that are threatened by the climate crisis should have an accessible way to rebuild and preserve their habitats while maintaining their cultural heritage. The habitats of the future should be climate-positive.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Innovative models and technology exists to design new sustainable ecosystems, financial systems, societies and create equal economic opportunities for everybody.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">People have a right to protect their privacy and access information freely. People have lost trust in centralized forms of governance and corporate monopoly.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 id="ectopia">Introducing Ectopia</h2>
              <p>We need an ecosystem that can deliver on the promise of circular economies, decentralization and financial independence.</p>
              <p>Advances in technology and new innovative models have made it practical to explore new approaches for infrastructure design, circular economies, new societal designs, innovative financial systems, secure digital networks to help the transition towards a more sustainable future and create new economic opportunities for everybody. Academic institutions, non-profit organizations, teams, and individuals around the world are passionately working towards achieving these goals. I believe that integrating these concepts into one ecosystem can accelerate the transition to the sustainable future we are all working towards.</p>
              <p>Building new sustainable ecosystems should be simpler and more accessible. Ectopic framework will be made freely available for designing and building innovative ecosystems, societies, and economies to lower the barriers to access for everybody and promote innovation.</p>
              <p>The initial design proposed for the ecosystem may sound like a project aimed for the premium market. And the question would be how that can solve the challenges being described here. Research and Development is expensive when it comes to the initial development of new technologies and models. </p>
              <p>By targeting the high end market, the project will be attractive to investors who are prepared to pay a premium to gain access to new and innovative solutions. Designing more affordable scalable models of these components will be possible once the first models are designed and tested successfully. </p>

              <h3>The plan:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Design a sustainable ecosystem built around cutting edge technology.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Use those learnings to design more scaled down and affordable ecosystems.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Design even more affordable and stripped down ecosystems.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Ectopia is made up of eight parts that works together as a framework to create sustainable and inclusive ecosystems:</h4>

              <ol>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">It has a stable, independent, circular economic model.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">It uses decentralized blockchain based digital ecosystem.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">It has a societal design with a flat social hierarchy that guarantees equality for all.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">It has a modular and scalable infrastructure design.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">It uses clean and renewable energy.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">It can produce unlimited fresh water and food in any environment.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">It uses design materials produced from waste for manufacturing.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">It uses zero emission, shared autonomous transportation systems.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2 id="labs">Ectopic Labs</h2>
              <p>Independent R&D hubs called Ectopic Labs will be setup globally with the mission to do research and development to achieve the Ectopic vision and to promote sustainability and inclusion. Ectopic Labs will collaborate with researchers, academic institutions and organizations working on solutions that contribute to the research and development of Ectopia’s components to accelerate the development of the ecosystem and foster innovation.</p>
              <p>For these partners, the lab provides them with a unique environment to access resources that makes it easier for them to solve problems and identify opportunities in a real-world setting. Through a combination of research, prototyping and trial and error, the lab will aim to be a global hub for testing potential solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges.</p>

              <h2 id="structure">Administrative Structure</h2>

              <h4>The Board</h4>
              <p>The Board will be an oversight body of the State that represents the Founders and Partners, to provide operational support for the State.</p>

              <h4>The State</h4>
              <p>The governing body for each of the Ectopic ecosystems which is comprised of representatives from each of the cities and an observer from the Board.</p>

              <h4>City</h4>
              <p>A council comprised of representatives from the neighborhoods that provides operational support at city level. Operational and policy decisions of the council require various voting limitations depending on the importance of the decision that is being made. </p>

              <h4>Neighborhood</h4>
              <p>A council comprised of representatives from the community members that provides operational support for the neighborhood.</p>

              <h4>Partners</h4>
              <p>Intergovernmental organizations, governments, financial institutions.</p>

              <h2 id="tocen">Tocen</h2>
              <p>A financial system built around a digital currency called Ectocen. Ectocen currency will be linked to decentralized economies that uses a complementary currency called Tocens that are backed by reserves called Vaults. The Vault will be administered by a Board that consists of Founders of the State. An independent not-for-profit organization called the Tocen Assembly will be setup to oversee the Ectocen currency.</p>

              <h4>Ectocen Currency</h4>
              <p>Ectocen will be an independent digital currency backed by the Ectopic economies. Ectocen’s value will be linked to the decentralized portfolio of Ectopic economies.

              <h4>The Vault</h4>
              <p>The Vault's initial reserve will be made up of commitments made by the Founders and Residents. These commitments will be in the form of fiat money or exchange-traded commodities like precious metals. Founders will be paid out by the State to cover their investments. Residents will receive incentives in Ectocen currency for their contributions to the economy. Residents will not be able to directly interact with the Vault. Representatives authorized by the Board will be the only entities that can transact large amounts from the Vault. The Vault will invest in assets that can generate interest over time. The revenue from this interest will be used to support the operating expenses of the State, invest in the Tocen global economy, growth, research and development of Ectopic ecosystems, grants to nonprofits and academic institutions, etc.</p>

              <h4>Tocens</h4>
              <p>A complementary currency used within Ectopic States that will be used to trade locally. The value of Tocens will be linked to fiat currencies or a portfolio of assets linked to the Vault to maintain a stable value. Each State will have their own version of Tocens backed by the Vault. There has to be a purchase that is equivalent in fiat money or exchange-traded commodities and transfer those to the Vault for new Tocens to be created. The value of Tocens may fluctuate as the value of the underlying assets shift.</p>
